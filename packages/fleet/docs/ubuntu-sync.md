# Developer fleet: one manager (macOS) and stateless workers (Ubuntu)

## Release status

This working-tree implementation is **not yet a completed or published fleet
release**. Do not describe it as having configured Chris’s machines. Required
acceptance checks remain incomplete: multi-target remote/bootstrap fault tests, unattended
paired T3 execution and live private-route acceptance, all five live provider routes, manager boot/scheduling acceptance,
off-host monitoring recovery, and the full Ubuntu drift/fault matrix. Disposable Ubuntu baseline
apply/repeat/reboot and pinned native T3 install/repeat/crash recovery/reboot passed.
The production boot-policy observer also passed inside the rebooted VM. Pinned
Beszel hub installation (including a missing Docker engine), repeat no-op and
reboot passed. Native Beszel agent installation, repeat no-op, crash recovery and
reboot also passed with an intentionally unreachable fixture hub; private metrics
acceptance remains separate. A further full SSH bootstrap test caught a T3 archive verification bug: release-builder UID/GID values are not the designated installation user. The shared installer now verifies local ownership, content, modes and links independently of archive-builder identity. The same test exposed restrictive-umask extraction drift; archive modes are now preserved and staging is verified before promotion. A fresh Ubuntu VM now passes the production strict-SSH source transfer, missing-prerequisite bootstrap, shared tool installation and baseline, then repeats with preserved SSH identity, developer work and managed-file timestamps. This uses a disposable exact test commit, not a published release or live fleet. Multi-target and interruption acceptance remains open. The VM caught and fixed an Ansible piped-stdin
variable-loading failure; runtime variables now use a private temporary file with
cleanup and never enter command arguments. See the
[reproducible VM test instructions](../../workstation/ubuntu/tests/README.md).
Real Beszel 0.21.1 binaries passed authenticated metrics, identity preservation and
supported API backup/restore in an isolated loopback fixture; that is not live fleet evidence. Incomplete
checks return nonzero; they do not advance a successful fleet receipt.

Newest and still unverified against live machines: the macOS convergence path
(`packages/workstation/macos`, launchd Beszel agent, fcntl remote lock), the Linux
always-on service drop-ins, and dashboard evidence inside `fleet-status --workers`.
They pass unit tests and Ansible syntax checks only; treat them as unaccepted
until a disposable-machine run and a live manager run are recorded.

## One command, from the manager

```sh
npx @crvouga/personal fleet-sync
```

`personal fleet-sync` executes the manager-push implementation:

```text
resolve enrolled fleet
→ inspect Tailscale and verified SSH
→ bootstrap missing remote prerequisites
→ apply one approved exact revision
→ establish fresh SSH connections and check readiness
→ report every target, including offline and blocked nodes
```

Bare invocation selects every canonical Linux and macOS node. It does not mean
“this computer,” and the manager is not implicitly a deployment target. Its own
node is targeted only if explicitly declared in Fleet membership. Ubuntu 26.04 is
the accepted worker platform; a node declared `"os": "macOS"` runs the same phases
best effort through `packages/workstation/macos` (see the platform matrix below).
Windows machines stay declared for diagnostics and are never converged.
`--node ID` filters troubleshooting/rollout. `--all` is an explicit spelling of the
default. Neither flag authorizes managing arbitrary Tailscale peers.

Roster-level workspace convergence lives in `personal fleet-repair --repair workspace`, which previews until `--apply --yes`.
The new manager report is version **2**, deliberately replacing the unshipped
local-first fleet-sync version 1 contract.

## Prerequisites and first enrollment

The manager needs Node/npm (Node `^22.13.0 || >=23.5.0`), an OpenSSH client,
a working Tailscale daemon, and Git for approved source preparation. npx cannot
execute without Node/npm. Existing shared setup remains
[`scripts/dev/bootstrap.sh`](../../../scripts/dev/bootstrap.sh); run that tracked
bootstrap on a manager without developer tools, then invoke the same command.
Do not install an unrelated fleet installer. The npm command’s help, catalog and
structured missing-enrollment result require neither Bun nor a checkout.

On first interactive use the command resolves only canonical machines through
existing SSH aliases, tests strict SSH access, and offers one enrollment
confirmation for the verified connections. The apply approval binds a fingerprint
of the selected revision, policy and connection records; changed bindings fail
with `FLEET_PLAN_STALE` before source preparation or remote mutation. It stores private overrides mode 0600. Unknown host keys are never accepted automatically. Compare fingerprints
out of band before enrolling trust. Unreachable machines remain listed; first
reachability requires an existing trusted LAN SSH route or physical setup of
SSH/Tailscale. No software on the manager can bootstrap a disconnected box.

A previously configured manager uses saved connection bindings and its approved
revision. A changed Tailscale device ID is a replacement gate, even if the old
DNS name and SSH alias still resolve. Enrollment never copies host keys,
Tailscale state, provider OAuth, or another machine’s T3 environment.

Remote developer-tool prerequisites are not required: the initial SSH probe uses
POSIX facilities. Approved application sends a Git bundle of that one commit
(its files, no history; the worker checkout is shallow) and the bootstrap
script extracted from that exact commit over verified SSH. A worker that
already has the revision receives nothing, and the toolchain setup is skipped
while its inputs (`mise.toml`, the locks, `scripts/dev`) are unchanged since a
successful setup within the last day. It installs missing
Ubuntu bootstrap packages through signed APT, then uses the existing mise and
frozen dependency installer. Bootstrap APT packages currently use the installed
Ubuntu archive configuration; strict dependency closure/snapshot promotion is a
remaining parity gate. The interactive manager flow can request native sudo authorization over a verified SSH terminal after the consolidated apply confirmation. It validates and installs the designated-user sudo policy; passwords are never captured or stored. Missing administrator permission, an unmanaged conflicting sudoers fragment, or unavailable terminal remains action-required. JSON and unattended runs never prompt and require existing noninteractive sudo.

## Policy, ownership and private state

- `packages/fleet/definition.json` and `definition.schema.json`: portable machine
  IDs, aliases, OS, singleton roles and Ubuntu release policy.
- Private manager overrides: `--config PATH`, `PERSONAL_FLEET_CONFIG`, or
  `~/.config/personal/fleet.json`, using the existing roster schema. Preserve
  workspace/runtime paths, capabilities and explicit `tailscaleId` bindings.
- Workstation network consumers derive their inventory from Fleet. The old file
  is retained only as `packages/fleet/migrations/workstation-network-v1.json` for
  lossless identity-path migration; conflicts fail rather than silently winning.
- Manager approval: `~/.local/share/personal/fleet/manager/enrollment.json`.
  Manager deployment lock: adjacent `sync.lock` directory.
- Remote source: `~/.local/share/personal/fleet/revisions/FULL_SHA`.
  Remote lock file: `~/.local/share/personal/fleet/remote-operation.lock`, held
  with `flock` on Linux and the same descriptor through Python `fcntl` on macOS.
  Never repurpose a development checkout or reset dirty worktrees.
- Workstation owns `ubuntu/`, `macos/` and `monitoring/`; mise manifests, locks and
  `scripts/dev` own developer tools. CLIProxy deployment/auth/recovery stays with
  `packages/cliproxy-fleet`. Cloud resources, DNS, Vault policy and tailnet access
  policy stay with OpenTofu and are not modified by this command.

The repository is public. Existing portable host metadata was retained during
migration; do not publish device IDs, private keys, manager-specific secrets,
credentials, backups or runtime databases. Intentional persistent policy changes
must be reviewed in Git. Emergency service restarts do not authorize permanent
untracked configuration edits.

## Preview, approval and results

```sh
personal fleet-sync --dry-run --json
personal fleet-sync --revision FULL_40_CHARACTER_SHA --dry-run --json
personal fleet-sync --revision FULL_40_CHARACTER_SHA --non-interactive --json
```

Preview can query Tailscale and establish read-only SSH sessions. It never enrolls,
authenticates to a provider, installs, creates pairing material, schedules work or
writes configuration. JSON/noninteractive modes never prompt or open a browser.
`fleet-sync` applies on invocation with no confirmation prompt; use `--dry-run`
to preview. `--apply --yes` is still accepted for existing scripts. Initial
trust/enrollment of new connections still asks separately.

Select one full lowercase commit SHA. Approval is saved on the manager and
retained throughout the run. New package versions do not silently replace saved
approval. Promote a reviewed release with the explicit `--revision SHA` invocation.
Use `npx @crvouga/personal@VERSION fleet-sync ...` for automation; unversioned npx
is convenience, not a reproducibility guarantee. Dirty review artifacts have no
automatically approved source SHA.

Version 2 JSON contains `execution: manager-push`, desired revision, per-node
reachability, applied revision (null when not verified), checks, durations,
candidate count and the private dashboard URL when the enrolled hub resolves.
An absent applied revision is not “unchanged.” Every required skip/failure keeps
readiness incomplete. Exit 0 means the requested read-only inspection or required
checks passed; 1 means incomplete/action-required/failed; 2 means invalid usage or
refused configuration. JSON is one document on stdout, with no child process logs.

These are distinct facts: configuration applied; local services healthy; fresh
manager connection verified; authenticated IDE/T3 tool execution verified.
Neither an HTTP 200 nor a successful installer establishes the last fact.

## Machine policy by platform

Every machine-level setting is declared in Ansible using only `ansible.builtin`
modules, applied by `node-converge` after source bootstrap, and then measured
independently. Bespoke TypeScript remains only where a native CLI or API has no
declarative owner: T3 service lifecycle, Beszel enrollment tokens, provider
verification and the CLIProxy singleton.

Credential sync is deliberately indirect: no secret is copied between machines.
OpenTofu issues each enrolled worker its own renewable periodic token
(`vault.tokens` entries `fleet-worker-<node>`, policy `personal-read`, sunk into
`secret/personal/prd` as `FLEET_WORKER_TOKEN_<NODE>`). `personal fleet-sync`
delivers each node's token automatically over SSH stdin (never as an argument)
whenever that node has no working Vault session. Interactive runs first log the
manager in (`vault login -method=userpass`, password typed on your terminal)
and fall back to the same password login on a node whose token is not issued.
Without either, the node reports `VAULT_LOGIN_REQUIRED` and its T3 proxy
providers stay unavailable. The manual equivalent of the automatic delivery:

```sh
vault kv get -field=FLEET_WORKER_TOKEN_CHRIS_VOUGA_MS_A2 secret/personal/prd \
  | ssh chris-vouga-ms-a2 'vault login -address=https://vault.chrisvouga.dev -no-print -'
```

From then on the node's `personal-worker-auth` timer renews that token and its
GitHub login, and renders provider configuration from Vault through Workstation.

## Ubuntu and remote-work safety

The declared common baseline is Ubuntu **26.04 LTS**, amd64/arm64. Other releases
receive `UBUNTU_BASELINE_MISMATCH`; there is no automatic release upgrade or
package downgrade. Workstation audits release, packages, service state and dpkg
consistency, declares snapshot sources for managed transactions, and pins its
selected APT packages. Unrelated applications and package sources are preserved.

Power policy masks sleep/hibernate targets and declares logind sleep/lid defaults.
GNOME lock/idle changes apply to the designated user only. Effective running
session/logind behavior still needs a maintenance/reboot acceptance check; writing
a file does not prove logout/reboot survival. The sudoers fragment is validated
with visudo before installation; this user and its agents can administer the
machine. SSH authentication remains enabled.

SSH forwarding changes validate the complete configuration before reload and
restore the previous fragment on validation failure. Existing listeners,
authentication and firewall rules are preserved. Existing socket activation is preserved for forwarding-only changes; listener
migrations and unmanaged fragments require review. The manager makes a **new**
strict SSH connection after apply. Private-listener/firewall acceptance and
failure-after-reload recovery still require disposable integration testing.

The manager is the only configuration coordinator. No per-node pull timer is
installed. Manager schedule controls use the existing platform adapter:

```sh
personal fleet-sync --schedule status --json
personal fleet-sync --schedule enable --revision FULL_40_CHARACTER_SHA --apply --yes
personal fleet-sync --schedule pause --apply --yes
personal fleet-sync --schedule resume --revision FULL_40_CHARACTER_SHA --apply --yes
personal fleet-sync --schedule disable --apply --yes
```

These are manager setup/maintenance operations, not per-node commands. Enable
and resume install the exact published CLI version in the managed manager
runtime and schedule the same whole-fleet command every 30 minutes at the explicit
approved SHA. They refuse dirty artifacts. Pause/disable remove only the manager
schedule. Re-enable with the new approved SHA when promoting a release; the timer
does not resolve `latest`. Linux user scheduling requires lingering; macOS uses
the existing LaunchAgent and requires a user session. Unattended manager boot
acceptance and log-retention configuration remain gates. No node pull scheduler
is installed or necessary.

Routine sync never reboots a box or deliberately kills IDE/T3 work. Explicit
maintenance reboot/reconnect orchestration remains an acceptance gate. Kernel,
driver, firmware, hardware and power failures are outside any “never freezes”
promise. Inspect disk/inodes, swap/memory pressure, `systemctl --failed`, and prior
boot journal evidence locally; sanitize it before sharing. Do not enable automatic
reboot-on-pressure or kill active work to obtain a green report.

T3 0.1.7's supported administrator policy at `/etc/t3code/policy.json`
disables independent updates and declares the existing managed Codex instance
plus an OpenCode instance for all five gateway models. Workstation reuses the
existing `agents/t3.json` renderer; it does not edit the live settings database.
Native `t3 policy check` validates before installation, and `t3 policy show`
compares staged policy with the running server. `T3_POLICY_RESTART_PENDING`
requires maintenance; no automatic restart is used to hide that distinction.
Unrelated administrator policy is a conflict requiring a reviewed merge.

## Central provider access

The `https://cli-proxy.chrisvouga.dev` gateway is a singleton service, so it
runs on the manager (`definition.json.services.proxy`). Workers consume that
gateway; no worker gets a separate OAuth-owning proxy. Keep the existing
key/endpoint contract, encrypted recovery and runtime authentication. Moving it
requires fencing the old host before restoring state
([migration](../../cliproxy-fleet/docs/migration.md)). Fleet never copies identities.

### Agents on every node

Every node (manager and workers) offers the same agents in T3, at the same
versions (pinned in `mise.toml`/`mise.lock`, including the vendor CLIs
`http:grok` and `http:antigravity`), signed in to the same multiplexed proxy
accounts. T3 launches most through a tracked launcher in
`packages/workstation/agents/` that injects the shared proxy key from Vault at
launch; nothing is copied between nodes.

| T3 provider                   | T3 driver     | Route                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Claude <account email>`      | `claudeAgent` | One per Claude account on the proxy (`claude-proxy`)            |
| `Codex <account email>`       | `codex`       | One per Codex account on the proxy (`codex-proxy.ts`)           |
| `AntiGravity <account email>` | `opencode`    | One per Antigravity account, via OpenCode (`opencode-proxy.ts`) |
| `Grok CLI Proxy`              | `grok`        | Pooled: Grok Build custom model, `env_key` (`grok-proxy.ts`)    |
| `OpenCode CLI Proxy`          | `opencode`    | Pooled accounts and Muse via OpenCode (`opencode-proxy.ts`)     |

**Accounts are never listed in this repository.** The proxy's credential files
are the only source of truth: every sync gives each Claude, Codex and
Antigravity credential the model prefix `<type>-<email>`
(`packages/cliproxy-fleet/scripts/accounts.py`, applied through the proxy's own
API), so the proxy's model list names every signed-in account. Each node reads
that list with its own proxy key and offers one provider per account, so all
machines list the same providers. Signing an account in or out on the proxy
(`bun run cliproxy add-account PROVIDER`, or the dashboard) changes T3 on the
next `fleet-sync`; an unreachable proxy fails the check and changes nothing.

A provider is pinned to its account: T3 sets `WS_AGENT_ACCOUNT` and the
launcher routes every request to `<type>-<email>/<model>`. Claude and Codex
send whichever model is picked, so their launcher runs a loopback relay
(`account-relay.ts`, alive only while that agent runs) that adds the prefix;
OpenCode is configured with exactly the account's models. Requests without a
prefix (Grok, the pooled OpenCode provider, health checks) still use the whole
pool, fill-first. T3's own Antigravity runtime cannot carry an account, so
Antigravity accounts run on the OpenCode harness. Cursor is not part of the
fleet (its backend cannot be proxied). Native Muse Code is not used: it only
talks to Meta's own catalog endpoint, so Muse models run through OpenCode.

### Checkout project actions

`bash scripts/dev/project-action.sh fleet-sync` warms the shared toolchain
and passes the current checkout HEAD as the exact revision to the existing approval
flow. Extra arguments such as `--dry-run` are forwarded. The manager can bundle
committed objects from this canonical local repository, including unpublished
commits; dirty working files are never transferred. Review and commit desired
changes before approving deployment. The Ubuntu baseline now owns the native
Docker engine, Compose and Buildx on every enrolled Linux workstation, preserving
third-party engine ownership conflicts and existing running workloads. Workstation
launcher/link convergence is part of the node apply, with credentials still checked
separately. A dependency receipt proves frozen installation inputs only.
