# Controller-led Ubuntu fleet setup

For the enrolled Ubuntu development fleet, run on the designated controller:

```sh
npx @crvouga/personal fleet-sync
```

Read the [Fleet operator guide](../../fleet/docs/ubuntu-sync.md) for enrollment,
approved revisions, bootstrap, provider checks and unresolved release gates.
Routine fleet updates do not require a command sequence on individual nodes.
The legacy local commands below retain their existing behavior for compatibility.

# Developer fleet configuration setup

Use **personal** for node and T3 configuration. Workstation and fleet are internal
implementation packages; neither exports its own executable.

After the shared [machine bootstrap](../../../scripts/dev/README.md), run in the
personal checkout:

```sh
bun run personal:install
personal fleet-node-sync
personal fleet-status
```

The npm fallback is the same interface:

```sh
npx @crvouga/personal fleet-node-sync
```

Use `PERSONAL_WORKSPACE` or `--workspace PATH` when invoking the npm CLI outside
the checkout. The installed source launcher resolves its checkout automatically.
Each machine still needs its own authorized Vault session, SSH keys and T3 pairing.
The sync never copies them or provisions infrastructure.

## Reconciliation

`fleet-node-sync` applies by invocation. It reconciles the locked toolchain, installs
one `personal` launcher, retires the repository-owned `ws` launcher, upserts the
Codex proxy profile, and reconciles T3 provider instances. `--dry-run` lists these
steps without writing or installing. The default node ID is the normalized hostname;
use `--id NAME` to retain an existing node's registry overrides.

The selected revision defaults to checkout HEAD. `--revision FULL_SHA` pins a
reviewed commit already fetched into that checkout. Deployment uses a clean Git
worktree and preserves developer edits. For whole-fleet maintenance, use the controller command above; this legacy local route does not orchestrate other nodes. A failed step stops later steps and reports
partial progress; it never claims authentication or inference was verified.

Portable models live in `agents/registry.json`; T3 desired provider instances live
in `agents/t3.json`. Edit these tracked definitions and deploy a reviewed revision.
New sessions use the updated configuration. Running sessions are not restarted.

## T3 plan, apply, import and cleanup

```sh
personal t3-plan --json
personal t3-apply
personal t3-status
personal t3-cleanup --dry-run
```

Plans show create/update/delete/unchanged/conflict by instance ID, with no settings
values or credentials. `personal t3-apply --plan-hash HASH` binds apply to the exact
settings, ownership state, desired definitions and destination reviewed in a plan.
A stale plan fails. A second apply with identical inputs performs no settings write.

A provider instance becomes managed when created by personal, or explicitly imported:

```sh
personal t3-import --instance personal_codex_proxy
personal t3-apply
```

Import grants ownership of the entire named provider instance. It does not change
its settings immediately. Subsequent applies reconcile that instance to the tracked
definition, including removal of extra fields. Existing unowned instances cause a
conflict, even when their names match. Unrelated instances and settings are preserved.

Removing an instance from the desired definition removes it on the next apply.
`personal t3-cleanup` removes **all owned provider instances** while retaining
threads, projects, pairing, native provider instances, credentials and profile files.
It does not delete T3's data directory or secret store. Historical threads may need
a replacement provider selected after their managed instance is removed.

`--t3-home PATH` selects a T3 base directory (otherwise T3CODE_HOME or ~/.t3).
`--definition FILE` selects a version-1 desired definition. Supported interpolation
is `${workspace}`, `${agents}` and `${node}`. The current schema deliberately supports
the verified Codex proxy adapter fields; it rejects inline credential definitions.
T3 proxy execution requires macOS/Linux/WSL; native Windows execution is unverified.

## State and concurrency

T3 owns `userdata/settings.json`. Personal merges only its declared instances and
stores IDs in `userdata/personal-managed.json`, with mode 0600. Private settings and
state backups sit beside that file. They may contain existing secret references or
values and must never enter Git or reports. Symlink/malformed destinations fail.

Personal operations use an exclusive lock, atomic replacement, pre-write freshness
checks and post-write verification. T3's own theme CLI uses the same optimistic
external-file update pattern; T3 does not honor personal's lock. Avoid concurrent
Settings edits during apply: there is no cross-process atomic compare-and-swap with
T3. No strict transaction across application and ownership files is claimed. Ownership
intent is saved before settings so interrupted creates/removals can be retried.
Inspect interrupted operations before removing a stale `.lock` directory.

T3's installed server source at revision
`322f6544dfad0a3c8a0c8cbecf2c7f7874b14268` was inspected for provider-instance shape,
external settings watch/reload, and optimistic CLI writes. Future T3 schema changes
require adapter verification. A disk-level success is not a live inference test.

## Other local operations

All former workstation operations are available through `personal workstation`:

```sh
personal workstation tools check --json
personal workstation agents verify --node NODE --tool codex --profile proxy --json
personal workstation opencode sync
personal workstation net check
```

`personal fleet-status` diagnoses the controller and registered remote nodes.
`personal fleet-discover` lists visible Tailscale computers. The local SSH roster
still requires real aliases and checkout paths; discovery never guesses these.
Use `personal commands --json` to discover the complete interface.
